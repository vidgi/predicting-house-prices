## Problem Description
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education and was provided for use in this [Kaggle prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). There are 79 explanatory variables describing aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

The problem posed is to find an effective method to use the given explanatory variables to predict the final price of each home. To do so, we will need to understand the dataset given with the basic structure, conduct exploratory data analysis, build a predictive model that can be trained, and test our model's effectiveness and final results.

Report and code is given in the Jupyter notebook in this repo.
